# AirBNBAnalysis

For this project, I analyzed a dataset of AirBNB rentals from across the USA to predict the average review scores and prices. In the increasingly competitive travel industry, understanding how to accurately price your AirBNB rental and which features are valued most by customers is essential knowledge for AirBNB hosts. For this problem, I created a Tensorflow neural network to analyze the amenities provided in each AirBNB and some various information about the host.
